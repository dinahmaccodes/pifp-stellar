//! # Types
//!
//! Shared data structures used across all modules of the PIFP protocol.
//!
//! ## Design decisions
//!
//! ### Config / State split
//!
//! A `Project` is internally stored as two separate ledger entries:
//!
//! - [`ProjectConfig`] — written once at registration; never mutated.
//! - [`ProjectState`] — written on every deposit and on verification.
//!
//! The public API exposes the reconstructed [`Project`] struct for convenience.
//!
//! ### Status as a Finite-State Machine
//!
//! [`ProjectStatus`] enforces a strict forward-only lifecycle:
//!
//! ```text
//! Funding ──► Active ──► Completed
//!     └──────────────────►┘
//!     └──► Expired
//! Active ──► Expired
//! ```
//!
//! Backward transitions and transitions out of terminal states (`Completed`,
//! `Expired`) are rejected by `verify_and_release`.
